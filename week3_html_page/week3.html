  <h2>Theory: Professional video production</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Professional video production has three phases: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-production: Planning details, making a script</li>
            <li>Production:	Shooting and recording audio</li>
            <li>Post-production: Editing the video</li>   
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Describe in your own words what are following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Synopsis: A synopsis is a short description of what happens in the film. 
                It’s the idea for the film, put into words.</li>
            <li>Shooting script: A script is the blueprint and foundation for the video.
                    Every film or TV broadcast is based on a script. 
            </li>
            <li>Storyboard: A storyboard is similar to a comic strip: each scene is drawn shot by shot, 
                showing the camera angles and framings to use. (the rule of thirds, composition, axis of action, 
                film structure, etc.)
            </li>   
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Problems if planning is not done well and into detail in pre-production:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>plot can be not logical</li>
            <li>story keeps jumping and make no sense</li>
            <li>waste of time</li>   
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>When creating video for ”normal” web use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>most common video aspect ration is 16:9</li>
            <li>Nowadays 1080p is enough almost for any internet use (1920x1080 pixels)</li>
            <li>24 fps – common video standards</li>   
        </ul>
    </div>

<h2>Task 1/3: The groundwork for your video</h2>

    <p>Aim: advertise the users to attract people to Finland</p>
    <p>Audience: tourists and potential sponsors</p>
    <p>Need of your target audience: information and introduction of Finland</p>
    <p>Desired action: download the app and start to travel</p>
    <p>Obstacles: Users want to travel to Finland but they might not have enough money to come.</p>
    <p>Main message: Welcome to Finnish winter</p>

<h2>Task 2/3: Video pre-production</h2>

    <p>First ideas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A person introducing about Finland.</li>
            <li>One friend visits a finnish and he or she shows around the city.</li>
            <li>Natural and city views with naration. (no actors/actresses)</li>   
        </ul>
    
    <p>Synopsis:</p>
        <p>Finland (Suomi in Finnish) is one of the northernmost countries
             in the world and it’s an awesome place to visit! During winter time, 
             you can enjoy a walk in a snowy world with everything white around you and 
             sun shines on your face. Explore amazing Finnish forests and lively 
             modern city in Helsinki with many fun people. You can also feed some swans 
             or ducks by the harbor and shop at the markets near by. In the end, we 
             visit the most beautiful church in Finland.</p>
